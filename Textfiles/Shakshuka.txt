Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon Aleppo pepper flakes
1 yellow onion
2 cloves garlic
1 red bell pepper
1 yellow bell pepper
28 ounces tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 ounces feta cheese (lactose)
1/3 cup pitted olives
4 eggs (egg)
1/4 bunch cilantro
Phases:
1. Cook the onion and peppers:  In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the paprika, cumin, and pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds to a minute to bloom the spices.
Add the halved and thinly sliced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add the thinly sliced garlic, red pepper, and yellow pepper (both seeded and thinly sliced) and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables soften.
2. Crush the tomatoes and simmer them with the peppers: In a bowl, break up the tomatoes with your hands. Add them to the skillet with the salt and cook for 5 minutes.
3. Cook the eggs: With the back of a spoon or a ladle, make 4 indentations in the sauce. Break an egg into a cup and carefully pour it into and indentation, being careful not to break the yolk. Repeat with the remaining eggs.
(You can crack the egg directly into the sauce and skip the cup, but itâ€™s easier to get a an errant egg shell or protect the dish from a bad egg if you use the cup method.)
Sprinkle the feta and olives around the eggs. Cover the pan and simmer over medium heat for 8 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are still soft. (If you like your eggs well done, cook for a minute or two longer.)
4. To serve: Garnish with cilantro leaves and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes. Bring to the table and serve from the pan.
