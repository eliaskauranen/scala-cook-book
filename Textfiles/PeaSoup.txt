Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion
1 stalk celery
1 clove garlic
1 piece fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 jalapeno
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon coriander
1 pound yellow split peas
8 cups water
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 lemon
1/2 cup vegan sour cream (nut)
2 tablespoons cilantro
3 tablespoons roasted, salted pepitas
Phases:
1. Cook the root vegetables and seasonings:
In a soup pot over medium heat, warm the oil. When the oil is hot, add the finely chopped onion, celery, garlic, ginger, and pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 8 minutes, until the onions are looking translucent and softened.
2. Add the hot pepper and spices: Stir in the cored, seeded, and finely chopped jalapeno, turmeric, cumin, and coriander. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.
3. Stir in the split peas: Continue stirring until they are coated all over with spices.
4. Pour in the water and bring to a boil, stirring: Add the bay leaf.
5. Simmer the soup: Cover the pot and let the soup bubble gently for 1 1/2 hours, until most of the split peas have fallen apart and are tender.
Stir the soup occasionally. If the soup looks like it has broken down at this point, add the salt, stir and cook for another half an hour until the soup looks thick and creamy then move on to step 6.
If your split peas still feel firm cook for an additional 30-60 minutes (2 1/2 -3 hours total cooking time) before adding the salt. Add more water if the soup seems too thick.
6. Taste the soup for seasoning: Once the split peas are tender, add the juice of one lemon. Stir to combine.
7. Serve the soup: Ladle into bowls and garnish with yogurt or sour cream, cilantro, and pepitas.
