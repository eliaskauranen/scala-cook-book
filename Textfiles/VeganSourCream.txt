Time:
250 min
Servings:
1 (1 cup)
Ingredients:
1 cup raw cashews (nut)
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
Phases:
1. Soak the cashews for at least 4 hours if you do not have a high-powered blender.
2. If you soaked your cashews, drain and rinse them until the water runs clear.
3. In a blender, combine the cashews, water, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and mustard. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary. If youâ€™re having trouble blending the mixture, or would prefer a thinner consistency, slowly blend in up to 1/2 cup additional water, as needed.
4. Serve immediately or chill the sour cream for later. Leftovers keep well, chilled, for about 5 days. The sour cream will thicken up a bit more as it rests; you can thin it by whisking in a small amount of water later, if necessary.
