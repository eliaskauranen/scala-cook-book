Ingredients:
0.5 pound sweet potatoes
2 cups black beans
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons cilantro
24 corn tortillas
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup creamy vegan cashew sauce (nut)
0.5 cup cilantro
2 cloves garlic
Phases:
1. Make the filling:
In a medium skillet, combine the shredded sweet potatoes with the black beans, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, and 3 tablespoons of the bean liquid.
Simmer the mixture until the sweet potatoes are tender; 6 to 8 minutes. Lightly mash the black beans and stir in the minced cilantro.
2. Warm the tortillas: Wrap tortillas in a damp towel and place in a 300 ̊F oven for roughly 10 minutes to warm.
Alternatively, wrap the tortillas in damp paper towels and place in the microwave for 20 seconds or so.
3. Assemble the taquitos:
Place a tortilla in front of you. Scoop 2 to 3 tablespoons of the filling onto the third of the tortilla closest to you. Roll the edge closest to you over the filling and tuck the edge tightly under. Then, continue to roll.
Place the taquito seam side down on a baking tray lined with parchment. Stick with a toothpick if necessary to keep the filling from falling out. Repeat with remaining filling.
At this point, the taquitos can be frozen for up to 6 months; see headnotes for detailed freezing and reheating instructions.
4. Bake the taquitos: Preheat your oven to 425 ̊F. Brush with olive oil and bake for 18 to 22 minutes until tortillas are browning and crisp.
5. Assemble the dip: While the taquitos are baking, in a small bowl combine the cashew cream with the chopped cilantro, crushed garlic, and half a teaspoon salt.
6. Serve: Serve the taquitos with the cashew dip drizzled on top.
