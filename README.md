# Smart recipe book
## Description
The recipe book can be used to store 
information on the user’s ingredients at home so that the user can update the information 
manually. The recipe book contains recipes which can be searched and filtered by category or 
ingredient by the user. The user can view the recipes and select the number of portions. The recipe 
book calculates the amount of ingredients accordingly and reports if the user has enough 
ingredients to cook the selected number of portions of the selected recipe based on the 
information it has. The user can mark the selection as cooked. Then, the recipe book reduces the 
amount of ingredients used in the recipe automatically from its storage of the user’s current 
ingredient situation.
## Guide
### Search recipes:
Type keywords for wanted recipes in the first field from the top separated with a comma. A 
keyword can be for example a food category, a recipe name, an ingredient’s name, or a special 
diet’s name. Example: Soup, Dinner, Mushroom, Vegetarian. Note that the program returns every 
recipe that fulfill every special diet among the keywords and at least one other condition, if “Wide 
search” is selected. This example should return all recipes for soup, for dinner, and for mushroom, 
which are vegetarian. If “Accurate search” is selected, the program returns only recipes that fulfill 
every keyword given. The example would return only vegetarian soups for dinner which contain 
mushrooms.
Type keywords for non-wanted recipes separated with a comma in the second field. A recipe that 
fulfills at least one of these keywords should not be returned. Note that you can list these also in the 
settings section, especially if you want to avoid something permanent or for a longer time so you 
don’t have to type it again and again for each search. Click the settings button to open your settings. 
The settings can be changed at any time.
Pick a number for the servings, select up to three special diets if you want (You can type more in 
the text field for the wanted recipes) and choose how the return recipes should be sorted. You can 
choose between how many times the recipe can be cooked with the current store situation and the 
duration of cooking the recipe (fastest first). Finally click the search button. You will see the name 
of the recipe and how many times it can be cooked and its duration. If the recipe can’t be cooked, 
you will see how much of each missing ingredient is missing.
### Have a look at a recipe and cook it:
Type the correct name of a recipe in the text field below the “Show recipe” text. Now click the 
show recipe button to have a look at the recipe. Click the cook this recipe button if you want to 
cook this recipe. You will be asked for confirmation. If you confirm, the recipe will be shown, if not 
already, and a right amount of ingredients will be decreased in your store situation. Note that a 
recipe can be cooked only if there are enough of all ingredients needed for that recipe.
### Keep your store situation up to date:
You can see your store situation if you click the store button. Please keep the store situation updated 
so that the program works correctly. If you eat something that is not made of a recipe of this recipe 
book, you have to decrease the right amount yourself. When ingredients are brought to the store for 
example after a grocery store visit, you have to increase the right amount for each ingredient 
yourself to keep the store situation up to date. Click the update store button to do so. In this section 
type the name of the ingredient, + or – (+ to increase and – to decrease) the amount, and the correct 
unit. An example is given, please clean it first from the text field.
### Create and edit recipes:
Click the create recipe button to create new recipes. Follow the instructions given so the structure 
will be correct, and the new recipe can be added to the recipe book. You can edit existing recipes if 
you click the edit this recipe button. To save the new or edited recipe click the add this recipe 
button. If the recipe has a same name as an existing recipe, the program asks if you want to replace 
the other recipe which would be deleted. You can either accept or go back and rename the new 
recipe.
### Delete a recipe:
Type the correct name of the recipe in the text field below the “Show recipe” text and click the 
delete this recipe button. You will be asked for confirmation.
Add or remove a density for an ingredient:
Click the density button and follow the instructions given. Also clear the example given in the text 
field. Densities are used to convert units related to deciliter to gram.
